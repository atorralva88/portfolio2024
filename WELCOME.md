Hello! And Welcome to my Writing Portfolio!

Here you will find a bunch of the writing I have done over the years and some writing that I am still actively working on. Some files couldn't be uploaded in their proper form, but I made due with what was available to me.

In the Essays folder you will find a bunch of essays I wrote at RIT. All of which I enjoyed creating. Each essay goes into depth about a specific film, book, game, or genre. These essays represent my inspiration for writing and are a big reason why I am passionate about creating the stories I choose to tell.

In the Film folder you will find two short films that I worked on. These short films were my first experience with writing professionally. On it I helped create story beats as well as coming up with the antagonist/monster in SCP Dollhouse.

In the General folder you will find a wide assortment of writing projects and other works that I am genuinely proud of. From poetry, to interactive mini stories, to hermitcrab essays.

In The Dark Sea you will find a bunch of files pertaining to my present ongoing worldbuilding project. I plan to add more to it as time goes on because it is genuinely a world I am passionate and excited to tell.

In the Video folder you will find two files. The first, labeled Editing Projects, was two short videos I edited in my filmmaking class. The first video, titled "Gnashing," was an attempt at telling a scene using only subtitles and audio provided to the class. The video titled "Where the Tulips Lie," is a video in which the goal was to establish a tone or theme using images and audio.
