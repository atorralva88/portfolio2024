This is the present active PDF that I use for my DnD games. The setting itself has been in development
for 3 years and is a collaborative world building project that I have been working on with the help
of my friends and players. I wanted to create a eldritch horror setting inspired by Mike Pondsmiths Cyberpunk.
This book and setting are incredibly important to me.
