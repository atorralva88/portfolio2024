This is the present active PDF that I use for my DnD games. The setting itself has been in development
for 3 years and is a collaborative world building project that I have been working on with the help
of my friends and players. I started this project because I wanted to create a eldritch horror setting inspired by Mike Pondsmiths Cyberpunk. This setting is intended to be difficult. I tell my players that "I do not plan for your survival in these campaigns, if you want to survive you will need to try." To help balance the scales a bit I created a new character option: Oddities. Oddities are extra features and abilities that can be added to a level 1 character. They are designed to be overpowered. In exchange the world actively hunts individuals with Oddities. If they are caught, they are subjected to changes/nerfs to their abilities or even death. I am so happy with how far this setting has come, I plan to add more to it as time goes on but for the time being my players love it and I couldnt be happier!
