Hello! And Welcome to my Writing Portfolio!

Here you will find a bunch of the writing I have done over the years and some writing that I am still actively working on. Some files couldn't be uploaded in their proper form, but I made due with what was available to me.

In the Essays folder you will find a bunch of essays I wrote at RIT. All of which I enjoyed creating. Each essay goes into depth about a specific film, book, game, or genre. These essays represent my inspiration for writing and are a big reason why I am passionate about creating the stories I choose to tell.

In the Video folder you will find two files. The first, labeled Editing Projects, was two short videos I edited in my filmmaking class. The first video, titled "Gnashing," was an attempt at telling a scene using only subtitles and audio provided to the class. The video titled "Where the Tulips Lie," is a video in which the goal was to establish a tone or theme using images and audio.
