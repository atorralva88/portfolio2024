I honestly couldn’t tell you how it started: How I wanted to be a writer. Part of me wants
to say, “it was always in me.” I remember being so young attempting to write heartfelt (and
incredibly cringey) poems to my first girlfriend. Or when I tried to make a crappy novel in the
highschool library. No matter where I start my story it hardly feels right for me to say that that
time in particular is where it started. It was at those times that I felt like writing was the thing I
had to do. School didn't make me want to be a writer at all. In fact it’s that very reason I am so
angry with the school system. In highschool, writing was only ever: Read this book - Now Write
about it - now read the next chapter, rinse and repeat. Writing never was something I wanted it to
be, it was always what someone else wanted me to write about. It took me quite a while to get
out of this mindset.

I feel like I really started viewing writing as “the thing I wanted to do with my life,”
when I got the chance to co-write a short film for the first time. I was barely out of highschool
when I noticed someone on youtube making short films surrounded by a community I liked:
SCPs. The short film I watched was called SCP First Contact. After watching it I decided to join the
creators community discord. This was at a time where I was beginning to understand the
fundamentals of filmmaking. I would watch the media and instead of just consuming the media
like I had been before, I became fascinated with the purpose of scenes and the gears and cogs
that made the story work. Suddenly storytelling became a puzzle that I wanted to know every small
part that made the whole. While in the discord, I managed to get on the owner's good
side and said an offhand comment like: “If you need help with x y z I got you.” I honestly don't
even think I meant it at the time.

Well long story short, he took it seriously. I was some random kid with ADHD who was nearly out of Highschool, 
and this semi-professional filmmaker was giving me a chance. With him I worked on two short films:
SCP Dollhouse and SCP Ghost Town. These short films would grow to pretty insane viewership. 
Even after all of this I still felt like I wasn't encouraged to write. People were excited for me for sure,
but it was hardly something I felt like fully chasing. When I got to college I majored in Computer Science.
It was good in the begining, the material itself was something I understood and enjoyed doing most of the time.
Eventually though I realized that if I wanted to be a writer, I had to use my opprotunities to the fullest. That 
was the moment I decided to switch majors.

Now I am a college graduate with a degree in Storytelling through Interactive Media and Visual Mediums (and a Minor
in creative writing).
