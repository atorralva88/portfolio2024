Hello! And Welcome to my Writing Portfolio!

Here you will find a bunch of the writing I have done over the years and some writing that I am still actively working on. Because I don't have access to many of the regular portfolio websites, I decided to stick with GitHub as its the respository I am most comfortable with. Some files couldn't be uploaded in their proper form, but I made due with what was available to me.

In the Essays folder you will find a bunch of essays I wrote at RIT. All of which I enjoyed creating. Each essay goes into depth about a specific film, book, game, or genre. These essays represent my inspiration for writing and are a big reason why I am passionate about creating the stories I choose to tell.

In the Film folder you will find two short films that I worked on. These short films were my first experience with writing professionally. On it I helped create story beats as well as coming up with the antagonist/monster in SCP Dollhouse.

In the General folder you will find a wide assortment of writing projects and other works that I am genuinely proud of. From poetry, to interactive mini stories, to hermitcrab essays.

In The Dark Sea you will find a bunch of files pertaining to my present ongoing TTRPG worldbuilding project. I plan to add more to it as time goes on because it is genuinely a world I am passionate and excited to tell. Included in the folder is the link to the PDF for the book, as well as additional matterial I have created for the setting itself. This ranges from journal logs from a crazed serial killer named "The Surgeon", to interactive websites I created to tell a story within the world. A lot of what I have created for this world has been purposely obscured, much like cosmic horror.

In the Video folder you will find two files. The first, labeled Editing Projects, was two short videos I edited in my filmmaking class. The first video, titled "Gnashing," was an attempt at telling a scene using only subtitles and audio provided to the class. The video titled "Where the Tulips Lie," is a video in which the goal was to establish a tone or theme using images and audio.
